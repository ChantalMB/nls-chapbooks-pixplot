    "description": "In verse.| Woodcut on title page.| This item was digitised as part of a project to digitise chapbooks printed in Scotland, in 2015. The images were captured at the National Library of Scotland\u2019s Causewayside studio by Picturae (https://picturae.com/). Transcriptions were generated from optical character recognition (OCR) performed by the National Library of Scotland. The collection was digitised as part of Library activity to make more Scottish collections available online and was also selected due to ease as all volumes are the same size. Digitisation was funded by the National Library of Scotland.",
